  \item Monica works on a temporary basis. The mean length of each job she
    gets is 12 months and the amount of time she spends between jobs
    is exponential with mean 3 months.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item In the long run what is the average number of jobs she works in a year?
      \item  In the long run what fraction of the time does she spend working?
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Three children take turns shooting a ball at a basket. They each shoot until they miss and then
it is the next childâ€™s turn. Suppose that child i $(1 \leq i \leq 3)$ makes a basket with probability pi
and that successive trials are independent. Determine the proportion of time in the long run
that each child shoots. (Assume each shot takes one time unit.)
Hint: Reviewing the geometric distribution could be helpful.

  \item A device has two states: ON and OFF. When it works normally, it spends a random time in the
ON state, then a random time in the OFF state, then again in the ON state, and so on. However,
when switched from OFF to ON, the device fails with probability 0.01 and a replacement process
is triggered immediately. Once a new device is in place, it is turned ON. Suppose that the average
durations in the ON and OFF states are 40 and 20 minutes, respectively, and that it takes 30
minutes to replace a failed device.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item In the long run what is the rate at which devices are replaced?
      \item In the long run what is the fraction of time that the device is ON
    \end{enumerate}
  \newpage
  \item After dropping off a customer, an Uber driver needs on average 10 minutes to receive a new
ride request and pick up the customer. 90% of the customers are short distance riders who will
pay $10 on average and whose ride lasts on average 20 minutes. The remaining 10% are long
distance riders who pay $25 on average and whose rides take 40 minutes on average.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item In the long term, what is the rate of customers the Uber driver serves, in units of persons per hour?
      \item What is the long term rate of revenue (money coming in from the customers), in dollars per hour
    \end{enumerate}

  \newpage
  \item Let $\left\{Y_k\right\}_{k \geq 1}$ be i.i.d. $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-valued random variables with p.m.f.
    \[
      P\left(Y_k=m\right)=2^{-1-m} \text { for } m \geq 0 .
      \]
    Let $S_0=0$ and $S_n=Y_1+\cdots+Y_n$ for $n \geq 1$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Is the process $\left\{Y_k\right\}_{k \geq 1}$ a Markov chain? Prove that it is not, or prove that it is and give its transition probability.
      \item  $S_n$ is a Markov chain as can be seen readily for example by following the reasoning of Example 2.1. So you need not prove it. What are the suitable choices of state space for $S_n$ ? Find the two-step transition probability $p^{(2)}(x, y)$ for $S_n$.
    \end{enumerate} 
  \newpage
  \item A fair coin is tossed repeatedly with results $\left\{Y_k\right\}_{k \geq 0}$. That is, these random variables are i.i.d.  with common
    probability mass function
    \[ P(Y_k=0) = P(Y_k =1) = \\frac{1}{2}  \]
    For $n \geq 1$ let $X_n = Y_{n-1} + Y_n$, the number of tails in the
    last two flips. Is Xn a Markov chain?
    Prove that it is or prove that it is not. An answer based on intuition
    alone may get some partial credit. Full credit comes from a rigorous
    solution. (Example 2.18 of the notes gives an example of how to prove
    that something is not a Markov chain.)
