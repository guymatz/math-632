\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose $X$ is a geometric random variable with success
    probability $p=0.4$ and probability mass function:
    \[ P(X=n)=p(1-p)^{n-1} \]
    Compute the expectation of $X$.

    \[ E[X] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\frac{4}{10} } = 2.5   \]

\newpage

  \item Which of the following statements are true?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Every real-valued random variable has a probability mass function.
      \item Every real-valued random variable has a cumulative distribution function. \checkmark
      \item Every real-valued random variable has a probability distribution.
      \item Every real-valued random variable has a probability density function \checkmark
    \end{enumerate}

\newpage

  \item Let $\{ X_k : k = 0,1,2 \dots \}$ denote a collection of random
    variables such that $X_k$ are independent Binomial random variables
    with parameters $n$ and $p$.
    Which of the following statements are correct?
    \begin{itemize}
		\item $X_k$ is an independent process but not an identically-distributed process
		\item $X_k$ is a renewal process
		\item $X_k$ is a stochastic process
		\item $X_k$ is an iid process \checkmark
    \end{itemize}

\newpage

  \item Let $U \sim$ Unif[0,6]. Calculate the expectation of the random
    variable $min(U, 4)$.

\newpage

  \item Suppose the waiting times $\{X_k, k \geq 1\}$ of customers at
    restaurant A (in minutes) are i.i.d. RVs distributed according to the
    Unif[0,8] distribution. If the waiting time exceeds 4 (minutes), then
    the customer will be served immediately. In the long run, what is the
    rate at which the customers are served? 

    Provide a numerical answer with precision up to 2 decimal places.

    Hint: Question 4 shows how to compute the expectation of the minimum of
    a uniform random variable and a deterministic constant. Then apply the
    Renewal theorem. 

\newpage

  \item Suppose the lifetimes of light bulbs used in a storage room have
    i.i.d. exponential distribution with mean 200 days. Suppose that a
    custodian checks the bulb exactly at noon every day. A burned-out bulb
    is replaced immediately upon discovery. Let $X_k$ denote the length of
    the k-th cycle. $X_k$ is a \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} random variable. (Fill
    in the distribution of $X$.) The long-term rate at which bulbs are
    consumed is \rule{1cm}{0.15mm}.

\newpage

  \item Every iid process $X_n$ satisfies the Markov property.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item True
      \item False \checkmark
    \end{itemize}

\newpage

  \item Consider a Markov chain $X_n$ with state space $S$.  Which of the
    following quantities must be equal to $P(X_4 = x_4 | X_0 = x_0, X_1 = 
    x_1, X_2 = x_2, X_3 = x_3)$ for $x_0, \dots, x_4 \in S$ provided
    $P(X_0=x_0, \dots X_3 = x_3) > 0$?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $P(X_4 = x_4 | X_0 = x_0)$
      \item $P(X_4 = x_4 | X_3 = x_3)$
      \item $P(X_4 = x_4 | X_5 = x_5)$
    \end{enumerate}

\newpage

  \item Suppose $X_n$ is a simple random walk with transition
    probabilities $P(X_{n+1} = b|X_n = a)$ equal to 0.5 if $b=a+1$ and
    equal to (1-0.5) if $b=a-1$.  If $P(X_0=0)=1$, what is $(X_3=-1)$
